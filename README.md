# FaKe_NeWs--ML

This repository contains code for a machine learning project that aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can simply clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/srivatsavavuppala/FaKe_NeWs--ML.git

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.6 or higher along with the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip or conda.

### Installing

To install the required packages using pip, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data

The data used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. The dataset contains a collection of news articles labeled as either fake or real. You can use this dataset to train and test your model.

### Running the code

The code for this project is written in Jupyter Notebook. You can open the notebook by running the following command:

jupyter notebook Fake_News_Detection.ipynb


This will launch Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, and you can run the code in the notebook.
